Overview
------------
PyAppLaunch is a simplistic application launcher written in python.

It seems everyone has a different idea of what an "application launcher"
is.  Naturally, I thought it should be something entirely different, so
I wrote PyAppLaunch.  It's essentially somewhere to keep and organise
all those BASH one-liners I keep forgetting.

You can configure each button with a name, a command to launch when
clicked, as well as what method to launch that command (e.g. sudo,
xterm, etc), and an abitrary number of "parameters" which will be prompted
for when launching the command.

You may also configure a button as a "group" which will contain another set
of buttons.

PyAppLaunch also has a DBUS interface which was designed with the purpose
of assigning a DBUS command to a hot key. Example using qdus:

qdbus org.latticepoint.projects.pyapplaunch /pyapplaunch org.latticepoint.projects.pyapplaunch.toggle
